<H3><A NAME=Introduction></A><FONT COLOR="#990000">Introduction</FONT></H3>
<P>The Apple&nbsp;II computer was originally released by Apple in 1977, and became very
popular during the first half of the 1980's. Even today, many people keep the memory
alive, by using an Apple&nbsp;II emulation program such as 
<A HREF="https://www.virtualii.com">Virtual&nbsp;&#93;&#91;</A>.
<BR>
The programs and data for the Apple&nbsp;II were usually stored on 5.25" floppy disks (or "diskettes"). 
These disks won't fit in modern day computers anymore, so emulation pograms cannot directly access them. 
Instead, the emulators use disk images, which are files containing the data of one diskette each.
</P>
<P>
A2V2 (which stands for Apple&nbsp;II - Virtual&nbsp;&#93;&#91;) is a macOS application that enables
the conversion of actual Apple&nbsp;II diskettes to disk image files as well as the other way around:
creating Apple&nbsp;II diskettes from disk image files. In order to do this, you need a
working Apple&nbsp;II computer with a disk drive and a serial port.
</P>

<H3><A NAME=Acknowledgement></A><FONT COLOR="#990000">Acknowledgement</FONT></H3>
<P>Part of A2V2 is based on the work of Paul Guertin, the author of ADT (Apple Disk Transfer).
The ADT application, which is used on the Apple&nbsp;II during disk transfer, is an open source project and freely
available via the Internet. For your convenience, version 2.1 of this program is bundled with A2V2 under
the GNU General Public License (GPL), which means the ADT source code is included as well.</P>

<H3><A NAME=WhatYouNeed></A><FONT COLOR="#990000">What do you need to use A2V2</FONT></H3>
<P>To use the program, you need two computers: a Macintosh and an Apple&nbsp;II. The requirements for each
are described below.

<H4><A NAME=WhatYouNeedMac></A>Macintosh</H4>
You'll use the Mac to run the A2V2 program, and to store the transferred disk image files.
It must run macOS version 10.11 or better. The application doesn't require much disk space,
not even for the converted diskettes (they are only 140 KB each).
<BR>
The Mac and the Apple II communicate with the serial RS-232 interface. This means that you need a USB-to-Serial
adapter. You can easily find such adapters with <A HREF="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Mac+USB+serial">
DuckDuckGo</A> or <A HREF="https://www.google.com/search?q=Mac+USB+serial">Google</A>.
<BR>
Make sure to find a compatible driver for your adapter, which can run on your version of macOS. Finding and
installing such a driver can be a bit challenging.
You know that the installation was successful if A2V2 recognized the serial port(s) in its application preferences window.
<TABLE BORDER=0>
	<TR>
		<TD VALIGN=bottom>
		<P><IMG SRC="Adapter.jpg" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=180></P>
		</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>

<H4><A NAME=WhatYouNeedAII></A>Apple&nbsp;II</H4>
You'll use the Apple&nbsp;II to run the ADT program, which reads and writes the diskettes and communicates with
the Mac through the serial cable.
There are a number of different Apple&nbsp;II models. If you have an Apple&nbsp;&#93;&#91; or Apple&nbsp;&#93;&#91;+,
it must have at least 48 KB of internal memory, and it must have Applesoft Basic in ROM.
If you have an Apple&nbsp;//e or Apple&nbsp;//c, it automatically meets these requirements.
<BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, you need a disk drive connected to the machine, able to access 16-sector 5.25" floppy disks, and you
must have a serial card. A very popular serial card was the Apple Super Serial Card (SSC), and ADT has been tested to 
work fine with it. Another option is the Apple Communications Card, which should also work, but is limited to very low
baud rates and therefore not recommended.
<P><IMG SRC="Super-serial.jpg" ALIGN=bottom></P>
<BR>
If you use an Apple&nbsp;//c you are all set, because it has an SSC-compatible serial connection and a
5.25" disk drive built-in.
<BR>
<BR>
The operating system you need on the Apple&nbsp;II is DOS 3.3, which always came with the machine. Other operating systems,
such as ProDOS or CP/M, do not work with the ADT application, but you <I>will</I> be able to transfer disk images
that have been formatted with those operating systems.

<H4><A NAME=Connecting></A>Connecting the machines</H4>
<P>
To connect the two machines, you need a serial cable that fits the connectors at both ends.
</P>
<P>
Note that when you connect two computers directly via a serial connection, you must use a modem eliminator, or null-modem cable.
If you have an Apple Super Serial Card, the modem eliminator is built-in: make sure the jumper on the card 
points to the word "Terminal" rather than "Modem".</P>
<P><IMG SRC="SCC-modem-eliminator.jpg" ALIGN=bottom></P>

<P>
On the Apple&nbsp;//c, the best way to go is to use an Apple&nbsp;//c serial <I>printer</I> cable. This is basically a
null-modem cable. Connect the cable to the Apple&nbsp;//c on built-in serial port no. 2. On top of that you might 
need some adapter or gender changer your cable to connect to the Mac USB-to-Serial adapter. This picture gives
an idea of the sort of components needed.

<H3><A NAME=Installation></A><FONT COLOR="#990000">Installation</FONT></H3>
<H4><A NAME=InstallationMac></A>Macintosh</H4>
On the Mac, make sure the USB-to-Serial adapter is installed correctly. Also make sure you're running
macOS version 10.11 or later.<BR>

<H4><A NAME=InstallationAIIHardware></A>Apple&nbsp;II - hardware setup</H4>
If you have an Apple&nbsp;//c, no special hardware setup is required; just make sure you connect the cable to serial port no. 2.
<BR>
<BR>
If you have an Apple Communications Card, set it to 300 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit and no parity.
<BR>
<BR>
If you use an Apple&nbsp;II with a Super Serial Card, set the DIP switches on the card as shown in this picture. Note
that some cards have an additional switch no. 8; this switch is a dummy and can be ignored.
<P><IMG SRC="Super-Serial-Card-switches.jpg" ALIGN=bottom></P>

Not all switches are equally important, because most options will be set from the software. This table shows

<H4><A NAME=InstallationAIISoftware></A>Apple&nbsp;II - software setup</H4>
When the serial connection is in place, the first thing you have to do is make a disk on the Apple&nbsp;II that 
contains the ADT software. This disk can then be used every time you want to work with A2V2. This step also 
verifies that the serial connection works OK.
<BR>
To perform this step, open the A2V2 Preferences window on the Mac to select the serial port to which you connected
the serial cable. If the port doesn't show up, stop the program, reconnect the USB-to-Serial
adapter, and try again.
<BR>
You don't have to choose a specific baud rate setting. The software will automatically select the correct speed.
<P><IMG SRC="Preferences.png" WIDTH=535 HEIGHT=241 ALIGN=bottom></P>
Note that the serial ports in your configuration might have different names than the one shown in the picture.
<BR>
<BR>
Next, click the button "Install Apple&nbsp;II software" in the A2V2 main window, and follow the directions
on the screen. If all goes well, you'll see the Apple&nbsp;II screen come to life with the binary codes
transmitted. This takes between 8 and 9 minutes.
<P><IMG SRC="Upload.jpg" WIDTH=286 HEIGHT=198 ALIGN=bottom></P>
After everything has been transmitted, the Mac sends a BSAVE command to the Apple&nbsp;II, causing
it to save the ADT program on the disk in the current drive.

<H3><A NAME=Transferring></A><FONT COLOR="#990000">Transferring disks</FONT></H3>
Start this function by clicking "Transfer disk images" in the A2V2 main window, and follow the 
directions on the screen. The main features of A2V2 are described below.

<H4><A NAME=Theory></A>Methods of disk transfer and supported disk image formats</H4>

		copy DOS 3.2 diskettes (they have 13 sectors instead of 16).
		<BR>

</TABLE>

<P>
If you are sure a diskette is formatted in a standard way, always use a sector transfer.
If you don't know how a diskette is formatted, first try to transfer it to the Mac
with a sector transfer, and test the result. If that approach doesn't work, try a nibble transfer.
If the result is still not satisfactory, try the half-track transfer. The latter two methods take
considerably more time than the sector transfer, but there is a good chance the resulting disk image
will work with the emulator.
</P>
<P>
Note that disk drives existed that were capable of reading and writing 40 tracks per diskette instead of 35. 
A2V2 and ADT do not support this format.
</P>

<H4><A NAME=ConfigureADT></A>Starting and configuring the ADT program on the Apple&nbsp;II</H4>
To start the ADT program on the Apple&nbsp;II, boot from a a DOS 3.3 (or compatible) disk, 
insert the disk that contains the ADT program, and issue the command "BRUN ADT".
<BR>
The program shows a screen like this:
<P><IMG SRC="ADT.png"></P>
<P>
The top line shows the configuration of the ADT program: it expects the serial card in slot 2, will
use 19200 baud as the transmission speed, and will use the disk in slot 6, drive 1. If any of these
options does not match the configuration of your Apple&nbsp;II, you can easily modify them by typing "C",
which gives this screen:
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="ADTConfig.png"></P>
<P>
Use the space bar or the up and down arrows to select an option, and use the left and right arrows to
change a value. The escape key returns without saving; the return key saves the new values and takes you back
to the main screen. The configuration options are explained in the next table.

	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>
		Use checksums
		</TD>
		<TD>
		Only applicable for sector transfer (not nibble or half-track transfer). DOS puts a checksum at the end of each
		sector as an error-detection measure. If the checksum is wrong, it means the data is probably corrupt, resulting
		in an I/O error. Setting this parameter to NO will skip this check: even if the checksum is wrong, the sector
		will be processed. This may be of some help in transferring unreliable disks, but be aware the results are
		unreliable as well. Thoroughly test the resulting disk image in your emulator!
		<BR>
        When you modify this parameter, ADT patches the copy of DOS in memory. If you're using a non-standard version of DOS,
		the code that checks for checksum errors may have been moved to a different address. In that case, ADT will show the

<P>
Note: configuration changes made this way are stored in memory only and not on disk. If you want to make the changes permanent,
read the section "<A HREF="#BundeledDisks">The bundled disk images</A>".
</P>

<H4><A NAME=SendingToMac></A>Sending a disk to the Mac</H4>
Insert the disk to be transferred in the configured drive of the Apple&nbsp;II. When you want to start a sector transfer, type "S"
on the Apple&nbsp;II. To start a nibble transfer, type "N", and for a half-track transfer type "H". Next, specify a
file name as explained under "<A HREF="#SpecifyingFiles">Specifying file names</A>". 
<P>The time required is typically 1 to 2 minutes for a sector
transfer, 3 to 5 minutes for a nibble transfer and up to 7 minutes for a half-track transfer.
<P>
Progress information is shown on the Apple&nbsp;II as well as on the Mac. On the Apple&nbsp;II, the ADT software
shows progress characters per disk sector, or per track in case of a nibble / half-track transfer. 
When a sector or track gets a "." it has been processed correctly. If a sector gets a "*", it could not be read. 
In that case the transfer <I>does</I> continue, but the erroneous sector is sent as all zeros. The resulting disk
image might not work correctly, and it is recommended to try a nibble transfer.
<P>
When a nibble or half-track transfer is complete, the Mac window shows a "reliability score", which is a number between
0 and 1. It tells something about how well A2V2 was able to analyze the track data. A higher number is better.
When the reliability is below 0.9, you have to be careful and test the resulting disk image thoroughly to see if 
everything works.

<H4><A NAME=SendingToAII></A>Sending a disk image to the Apple&nbsp;II</H4>
Insert a formatted, not write-protected, disk in the configured drive. Type the "R" command on the Apple&nbsp;II, 
and specify a file name as explained under "<A HREF="#SpecifyingFiles">Specifying file names</A>". The disk transfer typically takes 
1 to 2 minutes. Progress information is shown on the Apple&nbsp;II as well as on the Mac.
<P>
The best way to format a disk on the Apple&nbsp;II is to boot with DOS 3.3, replace the boot disk with the disk 
to be formatted, and at the Applesoft prompt issue the command "INIT HELLO". Or, if you want to format the disk
in a specific drive, do something like "INIT HELLO,S6,D2".

<H4><A NAME=SpecifyingFiles></A>Specifying file names</H4>
Sending a disk to the Mac requires you to specify the file name of the resulting disk image. In the same way, when sending
a disk image to the Apple&nbsp;II, you must enter the name of the disk image file to be transferred. 
<BR>
One way to enter the file name
is by simply typing it on the Apple&nbsp;II when prompted to do so. Using this approach, the file is created or read in the A2V2
work folder on the  Mac, which is always <CODE><B>~/Documents/Virtual&nbsp;&#93;&#91;/A2V2</B></CODE>.
<BR>
When the work folder doesn't exist yet, A2V2 creates it. Note that when you don't type a file extension, A2V2 appends the
extension ".dsk", ".nib" or ".v2d", depending on the transfer method. A file name typed on the Apple&nbsp;II cannot be
longer than 254 characters, and is not allowed to contain the character "/".
<BR>
Typing the "D" command on the Apple&nbsp;II shows an overview of the contents of the work folder.
<P>
The file names you can type on the Apple&nbsp;II are limited, because the machine won't let you type non-ASCII characters,
and on some machines you cannot even type lowercase letters. To avoid this restriction, A2V2 supports a special
feature: when you enter the file name "@" on the Apple&nbsp;II, the Mac will present a file open or file save
panel, allowing you to specify the file in a Mac-like way.
This method also allows you to work with files outside the working folder if you wish to.

<H4><A NAME=Canceling></A>Canceling a disk transfer</H4>
If you want to cancel an ongoing disk transfer, you must do so on both machines. On the Mac, close the "Transfer"
window; on the Apple&nbsp;II press ESC. After canceling on both sides, you can re-open the Transfer window and continue
with the next disk. When you cancel a transfer to the Mac, the file in progress is automatically deleted.

<H3><A NAME=BundeledDisks></A><FONT COLOR="#990000">The bundled disk images</FONT></H3>
<P>A2V2 comes with two disk images. They are:
<UL>
	<LI><B>ADT.dsk</B> - This disk contains the different flavors of the ADT program, and a utility program to
	make a permanent configuration setup.</LI>
	<LI><B>ADT Source.dsk</B> - This is for the technically inerested: it contains the full source code of
	the ADT program, plus a utility program to list the source on the screen or to print it.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
To set up an ADT disk with your preferences, first make sure you can transfer a disk to the Apple&nbsp;II,
as explained before. Then transfer the disk image "ADT.dsk" to the Apple&nbsp;II and boot from it.
You'll see a welcome screen that looks like this:
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="ADTDisk1.jpg" WIDTH=286 HEIGHT=198 ALIGN=bottom></P>
<P>
The first time you use the disk, you must choose option 1, which will guide you through the setup. You
must specify which ADT flavor you are going to use (Super Serial Card, Apple Communications Card, or Apple&nbsp;//c),
and you can change any default settings to match your particular configuration.
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="ADTDisk2.jpg" WIDTH=286 HEIGHT=198 ALIGN=bottom></P>
<P>The current value for each option is shown highlighted, and when you don't want to change it, just press
the Return key. When you are finished, the program saves a customized ADT program on the disk, containing 
the configuration parameters specified.
<BR>
The next time you boot from the disk, you can choose option 2, and go directy to your customized ADT program.
</P>
<P>
The third option is for the technically interested. It allows you to inspect (and copy if you wish to) 
the ADT source files. You don't need a real Apple&nbsp;II for this; it is actually more convenient to
use Virtual&nbsp;&#93;&#91;. The source files are on the disk image "ADT Source.dsk", and the program will ask you
to insert that disk. You are then asked to choose which file you want to list: the source of one of the
ADT programs, or the GPL (the license file). You can display each file on the screen or print it.
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="ADTSource.jpg" WIDTH=286 HEIGHT=198 ALIGN=bottom></P>
<P>
The "print" option is the best choice if you want to have a good look at a file, because Virtual&nbsp;&#93;&#91;
will produce a pdf file you can open with Adobe Reader or Apple Preview. 
<BR
>Printing also allows you to export the file:
in Virtual&nbsp;&#93;&#91;, select "Print to Clipboard" from the Edit menu, then print the selected file. Afterwards
go to a text editor and paste the results.
<BR>
Note that the Apple&nbsp;II takes a <I>long</I> time to read the text files. To speed up things a bit, the
disk image contains a compiled Applesoft program, but to make it go really fast, choose "Maximum Speed" in
the Machine menu of Virtual&nbsp;&#93;&#91;.
