  <description>Southwestern Data Systems recently came into the possession of this software product from the (Alien Sybmbols) Software Company.  Judging from the programming style, it was our suspicion that the original game was the work of Nhoj Dranseb, a leading programmer of the Bezardian planetary system.  Intensive reformatting efforts on our part have produced a disk which is compatible with standard Apple computers, despite the program's original existence on Bezardian computers.

Although it was immediately obvious that the program was a unique Hi-Res arcade type game, no translation of the game rules accompanied the package.

Rather than keep this terrific item to ourselves, we knew that the people who would enjoy this game would be more than capable of meeting the challenge in translating the enclosed instructions, provided in their original alien text.  In fact, we suspect that certain strategic advantages may be discovered by the more persistent investigators of this extraterrestrial culture.

Earthly users should not be offended by noticing that the aliens have understandably placed themselves in the defensive roles, with the "earthers" depicted as the enemy.</description>
